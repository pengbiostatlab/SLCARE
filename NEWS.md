# SLCARE 1.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* We can also use `formula` to handle the right-hand-side of the regression model. For example, we may use formula = "x1 + x2" in SLCARE().

# SLCARE 1.2.0

* I would like to thank the editorial team form R journal for useful comments to improve the package.

* Tentatively integrate colorectal dataset to our package, which was originally publicly available in frailtypack package (Rondeau et al. 2012).

* Update title for the cumulative baseline intensity function plot.

* Add default print to the model.

* Refine the documentation for model parameters.
