Title: Semiparametric Latent Class Analysis of Recurrent Events
Version: 1.2.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Qi", family = "Yu", email = "qi.yu2@emory.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),

Description: Efficient R package for latent class analysis of recurrent events, based on the semiparametric multiplicative intensity model by Zhao et al. (2022) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12499>. SLCARE returns estimates for non-functional model parameters along with the associated variance estimates and p-values. Visualization tools are provided to depict the estimated functional model parameters and related functional quantities of interest. SLCARE also delivers a model checking plot to help assess the adequacy of the fitted model.
